 Approach :--
The approach of the task of making a card using HTML and CSS.
First, I planned the structure of the card by visualizing what elements it would contain, such as
1.An image 
2.A title
3.Some text to explain the product 
4.A button

 Challenges i faced :--
 The challenge I faced while making this project was getting the text and buttons to align properly within the card. To solve this, I used padding , align-item , justify-content , margin. Ensuring the card looked good on various screen sizes, so I added media queries in CSS to fix this.
